# Automatic Ordering for Smart Inventory Management
___
##### _Most of the organizations have a separate department or job function called inventory planners who continuously monitor, control and review inventory and interface with production,procurement and finance departments. Large sales organizations handle enormous number of products and it is hard to manually keep track of demand and availability of each product. So, in this project we aim to create a system that can analyse sales data and predict future sales demand for all the products in the inventory using Machine Learning Techniques, and automatically place orders for product shipments if the inventory stock will not be able to meet the predicted demand_.
